 *** Open / Closed Principle : ( OCP )

    * ->  Software entities should be open for extension, closed for Modification


    Ex : 
        A plug socket doesn't change when new devices are invented , you just
        need to make new adaptors 

Bad : 

    * Modify class for new features

Good : 

    * Extend via new classes
