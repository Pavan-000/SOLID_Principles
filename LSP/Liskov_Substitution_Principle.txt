*** Liskov Substitution Principle : ( LSP )

    * -> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    * -> A child class doesn't break the parent behaviour.

    Ex : 
        A square is not always a rectangle if it breaks rectangle rules.

Bad : 
    Subclasses break parent behaviour

Good : 
    Safe Substitution
